            <p>Welcome to the Maximum Faggotery, world's finest page brought to you by some faggot.</p>

                <p>Hakumen (ハクメン) is one of (and said to be the leader of) the Six Heroes, and one of the original 12 playable characters in the BlazBlue series. </p>

                <p>Hakumen follows a rather unique blend of cyborg and samurai. He wears semi-heavy white armor and a muscular body suit with a large collar and the traditional hakama present, ballooning pants common in samurai. His long silver hair is tied at the mane. All armored sections feature fully-functional crimson eyes with slit pupils. These eyes are not as much of an intimidation as much as the mask he wears; a completely white, two horned helmet with no features or visor, appearing to have no face at all, a feature that paralyzes even Ragna in fear. </p>
